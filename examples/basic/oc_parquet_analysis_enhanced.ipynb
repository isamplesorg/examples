    "### Path 1 and Path 2: Complementary, Not Alternative\n",
    "\n",
    "The iSamples model provides **two complementary paths** from samples to geographic coordinates. They serve different purposes and provide different levels of geographic granularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Path 1 (Direct Event Location) - Precise Field Coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it is**: The **exact GPS coordinates** where a specific sampling event occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "MaterialSampleRecord → produced_by → SamplingEvent → sample_location → GeospatialCoordLocation\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: \"This pottery shard was collected at latitude 35.123, longitude 33.456\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics**:\n",
    "- Precise, field-recorded GPS point\n",
    "- Specific to each sampling event\n",
    "- Different events at the same site typically have different Path 1 coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use case**: \"Show me the exact spot where this sample was collected\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Path 2 (Via Sampling Site) - Administrative Site Location\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it is**: The **representative or administrative location** for a named archaeological site that groups related samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "MaterialSampleRecord → produced_by → SamplingEvent → sampling_site → SamplingSite → site_location → GeospatialCoordLocation\n",
    "```\n",

    "**Example**: \"This sample came from the PKAP Survey Area, whose general location is lat 34.987, lon 33.708\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics**:\n",
    "- One representative point for the entire site\n",
    "- Administrative/reference location that groups related samples\n",
    "- Many events at the same site share the **same** Path 2 location but have **different** Path 1 locations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use case**: \"Show me the general area/site where this sample came from\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### CRITICAL: Complementary Levels of Granularity, Not Alternatives\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **WRONG**: \"Use Path 1 OR Path 2 to get the coordinates\" (implies they return the same result)\n",

    "✅ **CORRECT**: \n",
    "- **Path 1** = precise individual sample location (fine-grained)\n",

    "Top sample_location geos by event count:\n",

    "- geoloc_9797bec3...: 754 events at this precise spot  \n",
    "- geoloc_67f077ed...: 577 events at this precise spot\n",
    "... (541 more unique field locations)\n",
    "- geoloc_ff64156b... (matches site_location): only 106 events\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**: \n",
    "- **Path 2** tells you: \"All these samples belong to PKAP Survey Area at (34.987, 33.708)\"\n",
    "- **Path 1** tells you: \"But they were actually collected at 544 different specific GPS points within that survey area\"\n",
    "- Both pieces of information are useful for different purposes!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contrast: Suberde (Small Compact Site)\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all sites have many different locations. **Suberde** shows when Path 1 and Path 2 converge:\n",

    "### Comparison: Raw SQL vs Ibis\n",
    "\n",
    "Both approaches implement the same **generic PQG graph traversal patterns**. The Ibis versions offer several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Readability Benefits:**\n",
    "1. **Clear separation**: Generic PQG operations (joins on s/p/o) vs OpenContext filters (entity types)\n",
    "2. **Meaningful aliases**: `samples`, `events`, `locations` make the domain model clear\n",
    "3. **Method chaining**: Natural Python syntax that reads left-to-right\n",
    "4. **Type safety**: Ibis can catch column reference errors at definition time\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Maintainability Benefits:**\n",
    "1. **Modular queries**: Easy to swap OpenContext predicates without changing graph traversal logic\n",
    "2. **Reusable components**: Base table filters separate framework from domain\n",
    "3. **IDE support**: Auto-completion works for both PQG fields and domain fields\n",
    "4. **Debugging**: Can inspect intermediate results by executing partial chains\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Performance Considerations:**\n",
    "- Both compile to the same SQL, leveraging DuckDB's query optimizer\n",
    "- The graph traversal pattern (joining through edges) is the same\n",
    "- Performance is determined by the underlying PQG structure, not the query interface"

    "- Fixed duplicate CTE names in the visualization function by using unique aliases\n",
    "- All Ibis queries now execute successfully\n",

    "1. **Much cleaner syntax** for multi-step joins - no more cryptic SQL aliases\n",

    "3. **Reusable components** - define edge tables once, use multiple times\n",

    "5. **IDE support** - auto-completion and type checking work better\n",

    "## Query Performance Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "These tips apply to both **generic PQG patterns** and **OpenContext-specific** queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generic PQG Optimization:\n",
    "1. **Filter edges first**: Use `otype = '_edge_'` early in WHERE clauses\n",
    "2. **Use array indexing carefully**: `o[1]` for first target in edge arrays\n",
    "3. **Leverage row_id indexes**: Join on row_id fields for best performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### OpenContext-Specific Optimization:\n",
    "1. **Filter by entity type early**: e.g., `otype = 'MaterialSampleRecord'`\n",
    "2. **Use domain predicates**: Filter edges by specific predicates like `produced_by`\n",
    "3. **Limit geographic queries**: Add bounds when querying latitude/longitude\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory Management for Large Graphs:\n",
    "- Simple node counts: Fast (<1 second)\n",
    "- Single-hop edge traversal: Moderate (1-5 seconds)\n",
    "- Multi-hop graph traversal: Can be slow (5-30 seconds)\n",
    "- Full graph scans: Avoid without filters"
